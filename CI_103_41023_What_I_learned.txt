For the future of this project, the .gitlab-ci.yml file must now contain scripts that run the python files. The scripts can be setup as follows:
build-code-job:
  stage: build
  script:
    - echo "Check the ruby version, then build some Ruby project files:"
    - ruby -v
    - rake
The script is a separate file that must be created with the .sh file type. For the next steps of the project I will need to create and implement scripts that correspond to our two python files and any more files that will be created. All the information that I have learned is from this website The `.gitlab-ci.yml` file | GitLab and I will use this website more when I begin to implement the code.
