# TrackIt
TrackIt is a gamer-focused utility web application that allows gamers to track their stats across tons of games in one centralized place!

TrackIt is a gaming stat website that tracks the stats that gamers have from various games when the user inputs information such as usernames. Our website then uses the respective video game APIs to get the stats and images that correspond to the user's profiles.
